                       (IPA: [ʃriː laŋkaː]); Tamil: இலங்கை, romanized: Ilaṅkai (IPA: [ilaŋɡaj])), formerly known as Ceylon and 
                       officially the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, is an island country in South Asia. It lies in 
                       the Indian Ocean, southwest of the Bay of Bengal, and southeast of the Arabian Sea; it is separated from 
                       the Indian subcontinent by the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait. Sri Lanka shares a maritime border with 
                       India and the Maldives. Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is its legislative capital, and Colombo is its largest city 
                       and financial centre.
                       <br><br>
                       Sri Lanka has a population of around 22 million (2020) and is a multinational state, home to diverse cultures, 
                       languages, and ethnicities. The Sinhalese are the majority of the nation's population. The Tamils, who are a 
                       large minority group, have also played an influential role in the island's history. Other long established groups 
                       include the Moors, the Burghers, the Malays, the Chinese, and the indigenous Vedda.
                       <br><br>
                       Sri Lanka's documented history goes back 3,000 years, with evidence of prehistoric human settlements that dates 
                       back at least 125,000 years. The earliest known Buddhist writings of Sri Lanka, known collectively as the Pāli 
                       canon, date to the fourth Buddhist council, which took place in 29 BCE. Also called the Teardrop of India, 
                       or the Granary of the East, Sri Lanka's geographic location and deep harbours have made it of great strategic 
                       importance, from the earliest days of the ancient Silk Road trade route to today's so-called maritime Silk Road.
                        Because its location made it a major trading hub, it was already known to both Far Easterners and Europeans 
                       as long ago as the Anuradhapura period (377 BC–1017 AD). During a period of great political crisis in the Kingdom of 
                       Kotte, the Portuguese arrived in Sri Lanka and sought to control the island's maritime trade, with a part of Sri Lanka 
                       subsequently becoming a Portuguese possession. After the Sinhalese-Portuguese war, the Dutch and the Kingdom of Kandy 
                       took control of those areas. The Dutch possessions were then taken by the British, who later extended their control 
                       over the whole island, colonising it from 1815 to 1948. A national movement for political independence arose in the 
                       early 20th century, and in 1948, Ceylon became a dominion. The dominion was succeeded by the republic named Sri Lanka 
                       in 1972. Sri Lanka's more recent history was marred by a 26-year civil war, which began in 1983 and ended decisively 
                       in 2009, when the Sri Lanka Armed Forces defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.

                       Sri Lanka is a developing country, ranking 73rd on the Human Development Index. It is the highest-ranked South Asian 
                       nation in terms of development and has the second-highest per capita income in South Asia; however, the ongoing economic
                       crisis has resulted in the collapse of the currency, rising inflation, and a humanitarian crisis due to a severe 
                       shortage of essentials. It has also led to an eruption of street protests, with citizens successfully demanding 
                       that the president and the government step down. The island has had a long history of engagement with modern 
                       international groups: it is a founding member of the SAARC and a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth 
                       of Nations, the G77, and the Non-Aligned Movement.

                    <p style="color:rgb(168, 158, 158) ;">Sri Lanka is a pear-shaped Island nation in South Asia, lying on the Indian Plate, a major tectonic plate that was 
                       formerly part of the Indo-Australian Plate. It is in the Indian Ocean southwest of the Bay of Bengal, between 
                       latitudes 5° and 10° N, and longitudes 79° and 82° E. Sri Lanka is separated from the mainland portion of the 
                       Indian subcontinent by the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Strait. According to Hindu mythology, a land bridge existed between 
                       the Indian mainland and Sri Lanka. It now amounts to only a chain of limestone shoals remaining above sea level. 
                       Legends claim that it was passable on foot up to 1480 CE, until cyclones deepened the channel. Portions are 
                       still as shallow as 1 metre (3 ft), hindering navigation. The island consists mostly of flat to rolling coastal 
                       plains, with mountains rising only in the south-central part. The highest point is Pidurutalagala, reaching 2,524 
                       metres (8,281 ft) above sea level.Sri Lanka has 103 rivers. The longest of these is the Mahaweli River, extending 
                       335 kilometres (208 mi). These waterways give rise to 51 natural waterfalls of 10 metres (33 ft) or more. The 
                       highest is Bambarakanda Falls, with a height of 263 metres (863 ft). Sri Lanka's coastline is 1,585 km (985 mi) 
                       long. Sri Lanka claims an exclusive economic zone extending 200 nautical miles, which is approximately 6.7 
                       times Sri Lanka's land area. The coastline and adjacent waters support highly productive marine ecosystems such 
                       as fringing coral reefs and shallow beds of coastal and estuarine seagrasses.
                       <br><br>
                       Sri Lanka has 45 estuaries and 40 lagoons. Sri Lanka's mangrove ecosystem spans over 7,000 hectares and 
                       played a vital role in buffering the force of the waves in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The island is 
                       rich in minerals such as ilmenite, feldspar, graphite, silica, kaolin, mica and thorium. Existence 
                       of petroleum and gas in the Gulf of Mannar has also been confirmed, and the extraction of recoverable quantities 
                       is underway.

                    <p style="color:rgb(168, 158, 158) ;">The climate is tropical and warm because of moderating effects of ocean winds. Mean temperatures range from 17 °C 
                       (62.6 °F) in the central highlands, where frost may occur for several days in the winter, to a maximum of 33 °C 
                       (91.4 °F) in low-altitude areas. Average yearly temperatures range from 28 °C (82.4 °F) to nearly 31 °C (87.8 °F). 
                       Day and night temperatures may vary by 14 °C (57.2 °F) to 18 °C (64.4 °F).[174]
                       <br><br>
                       The rainfall pattern is influenced by monsoon winds from the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal. The "wet zone" 
                       and some of the windward slopes of the central highlands receive up to 2,500 millimetres (98.4 in) of rain each 
                       year, but the leeward slopes in the east and northeast receive little rain. Most of the east, southeast, and 
                       northern parts of Sri Lanka comprise the "dry zone", which receives between 1,200 and 1,900 mm (47 and 75 in) 
                       of rain annually.
                       <br><br>
                       The arid northwest and southeast coasts receive the least rain at 800 to 1,200 mm (31 to 47 in) per year. 
                       Periodic squalls occur and sometimes tropical cyclones bring overcast skies and rains to the southwest, 
                       northeast, and eastern parts of the island. Humidity is typically higher in the southwest and mountainous 
                       areas and depends on the seasonal patterns of rainfall.[176] An increase in average rainfall coupled with 
                       heavier rainfall events has resulted in recurrent flooding and related damages to infrastructure, utility 
                       supply and the urban economy.

                    <p style="color:rgb(168, 158, 158) ;">The current political culture in Sri Lanka is a contest between two rival coalitions led by the centre-left and 
                        progressive United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA), an offspring of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), and the 
                        comparatively right-wing and pro-capitalist United National Party (UNP).Sri Lanka is essentially a 
                        multi-party democracy with many smaller Buddhist, socialist, and Tamil nationalist political parties. As of 
                        July 2011, the number of registered political parties in the country is 67. Of these, the Lanka Sama 
                        Samaja Party (LSSP), established in 1935, is the oldest.
                        <br><br>
                       The UNP, established by D. S. Senanayake in 1946, was until recently the largest single political party.
                       It is the only political group which had representation in all parliaments since independence.SLFP was 
                       founded by S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike in July 1951. SLFP registered its first victory in 1956, defeating the 
                       ruling UNP in the 1956 Parliamentary election. Following the parliamentary election in July 1960, Sirimavo 
                       Bandaranaike became the prime minister and the world's first elected female head of government.
                       <br><br>
                       G. G. Ponnambalam, the Tamil nationalist counterpart of S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike,founded the All Ceylon 
                       Tamil Congress (ACTC) in 1944. Objecting to Ponnambalam's cooperation with D. S. Senanayake, a dissident group 
                       led by S.J.V. Chelvanayakam broke away in 1949 and formed the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK), also known as 
                       the Federal Party, becoming the main Tamil political party in Sri Lanka for next two decades. The Federal 
                       Party advocated a more aggressive stance toward the Sinhalese.With the constitutional reforms of 1972, the 
                       ACTC and ITAK created the Tamil United Front (later Tamil United Liberation Front). Following a period of turbulence 
                       as Tamil militants rose to power in the late 1970s, these Tamil political parties were succeeded in October 2001 by 
                       the Tamil National Alliance. Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, a Marxist–Leninist political party founded by 
                       Rohana Wijeweera in 1965, serves as a third force in the current political context. It endorses leftist 
                       policies which are more radical than the traditionalist leftist politics of the LSSP and the Communist Party.
                        Founded in 1981, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress is the largest Muslim political party in Sri Lanka.

                       President Mahinda Rajapaksa lost the 2015 presidential elections, ending his ten-year presidency. However, 
                       his successor as Sri Lankan President, Maithripala Sirisena, decided not to seek re-election in 2019.
                       The Rajapaksa family regained power in November 2019 presidential elections when Mahinda's younger brother 
                       and former wartime defence chief Gotabaya Rajapaksa won the election, and he was later sworn in as the new 
                       president of Sri Lanka. Their firm grip of power was consolidated in the parliamentary elections in 
                       August 2020. The family's political party, Sri Lanka People's Front (known by its Sinhala initials SLPP), 
                       obtained a landslide victory and a clear majority in the parliament. Five members of the Rajapaksa family won 
                       seats in the new parliament. Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa became the new prime minister
                       <br><br>
                       In 2022, a political crisis started due to the power struggle between President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the 
                       Parliament of Sri Lanka. The crisis was fuelled by anti-government protests and demonstrations by the public 
                       and also due to the worsening economy of Sri Lanka since 2019. The anti-government sentiment across various 
                       parts of Sri Lanka has triggered unprecedented political instability, creating shockwaves in the political arena.

                       when the 13th Amendment of the 1978 constitution established provincial councils after several decades of 
                       increasing demand for a decentralisation of the government. Each provincial council is an autonomous 
                       body not under the authority of any ministry. Some of its functions had been undertaken by central government 
                       ministries, departments, corporations, and statutory authorities, but authority over land and police is not 
                       as a rule given to provincial councils. Between 1989 and 2006, the Northern and Eastern provinces were 
                       temporarily merged to form the North-East Province. Prior to 1987, all administrative tasks for the 
                       provinces were handled by a district-based civil service which had been in place since colonial times. Now each 
                       province is administered by a directly elected provincial council:

                       Sri Lanka became a plantation economy famous for its production and export of cinnamon, rubber, and Ceylon 
                       tea, which remains a trademark national export. The development of modern ports under British rule raised 
                       the strategic importance of the island as a centre of trade. From 1948 to 1977, socialism strongly influenced 
                       the government's economic policies. Colonial plantations were dismantled, industries were nationalised, and a welfare 
                       state established. In 1977, the free market economy was introduced to the country, incorporating privatisation, 
                       deregulation, and the promotion of private enterprise.While the production and export of tea, rubber, coffee,

                       rice production, and other agricultural products. In addition to these economic sectors, overseas employment,

                       The 2011 Global Competitiveness Report, published by the World Economic Forum, described Sri Lanka's 
                       economy as transitioning from the factor-driven stage to the efficiency-driven stage and that it ranked 
                       52nd in global competitiveness.Also, out of the 142 countries surveyed, Sri Lanka ranked 45th in 
                       health and primary education, 32nd in business sophistication, 42nd in innovation, and 41st in goods market 
                       efficiency. In 2016, Sri Lanka ranked 5th in the World Giving Index, registering high levels of contentment 
                       and charitable behaviour in its society. In 2010, The New York Times placed Sri Lanka at the top of its 
                       list of 31 places to visit. S&P Dow Jones Indices classifies Sri Lanka as a frontier market as of 2018.

                       By 2016, the country's debt soared as it was developing its infrastructure to the point of near bankruptcy
                       which required a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF had agreed to provide a 
                       US$1.5 billion bailout loan in April 2016 after Sri Lanka provided a set of criteria intended to improve its 
                       economy. By the fourth quarter of 2016, the debt was estimated to be $64.9 billion. Additional debt had been 
                       incurred in the past by state-owned organisations and this was said to be at least $9.5 billion. Since early 
                       2015, domestic debt increased by 12% and external debt by 25%. In November 2016, the IMF reported that 
                       the initial disbursement was larger than US$150 million originally planned, a full US$162.6 million 
                       (SDR 119.894 million). The agency's evaluation for the first tranche was cautiously optimistic about the future. 
                       Under the program, the Sri Lankan government implemented a new Inland Revenue Act and an automatic fuel pricing 
                       formula which was noted by the IMF in its fourth review. In 2018 China agreed to bail out Sri Lanka with a loan 
                       of $1.25 billion to deal with foreign debt repayment spikes in 2019 to 2021.

                       In September 2021, Sri Lanka declared a major economic crisis. The Chief of its Central Bank has stepped 
                       down amid the crisis. The Parliament has declared emergency regulations due to the crisis, seeking to ban 
                       "food hoarding".

                       Tourism, which provided the economy with an input of foreign currency, has been significantly impacted as 
                       a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
