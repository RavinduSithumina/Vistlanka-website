                        <h4><u>Sigiriya</u></h4>
                         Sigiriya or Sinhagiri (Lion Rock Sinhala: සීගිරිය, Tamil: சிகிரியா/சிங்ககிரி, pronounced see-gi-ri-yə) 
                         is an ancient rock fortress located in the northern Matale District near the town of Dambulla in the 
                         Central Province, Sri Lanka. It is a site of historical and archaeological significance that is dominated by 
                         a massive column of rock approximately 180 m (590 ft) high.
                         <br><br>
                         According to the ancient Sri Lankan chronicle the Cūḷavaṃsa, this area was a large forest, 
                         then after storms and landslides it became a hill and was selected by King Kashyapa (AD 477 – 495) 
                         for his new capital. He built his palace on top of this rock and decorated its sides with colourful frescoes. 
                         On a small plateau about halfway up the side of this rock he built a gateway in the form of an enormous lion. 
                         The name of this place is derived from this structure; Sīnhāgiri, the Lion Rock (an etymology similar to Sinhapura, 
                         the Sanskrit name of Singapore, the Lion City).
                         <br><br>
                         The capital and the royal palace were abandoned after the king's death. It was used as a Buddhist monastery 
                         until the 14th century. Sigiriya today is a UNESCO listed World Heritage Site. It is one of the best preserved 
                         examples of ancient urban planning.

                        <h4>Archaeological remains and features</h4>
                         
                         In 1831 Major Jonathan Forbes of the 78th Highlanders of the British Army, while returning on horseback from 
                         a trip to Pollonnuruwa, encountered the "bush covered summit of Sigiriya". Sigiriya came to the attention 
                         of antiquarians and, later, archaeologists. Archaeological work at Sigiriya began on a small scale in the 1890s.
                         H.C.P. Bell was the first archaeologist to conduct extensive research on Sigiriya. The Cultural Triangle Project, 
                         launched by the Government of Sri Lanka, focused its attention on Sigiriya in 1982. Archaeological work began on the 
                         entire city for the first time under this project. There was a sculpted lion's head above the legs and paws flanking 
                         the entrance, but the head collapsed years ago.
                         <br><br>
                         Sigiriya consists of an ancient citadel built by King Kashyapa during the 5th century. 
                         The Sigiriya site contains the ruins of an upper palace located on the flat top of the rock, 
                         a mid-level terrace that includes the Lion Gate and the mirror wall with its frescoes, the lower palaces clings 
                         to the slopes below the rocks. The moats, walls and gardens of the palace extended for a few hundred metres from 
                         the base of the rock. The site was both a palace and a fortress. The upper palace on the top of the rock includes 
                         cisterns cut into the rock.
                         <br><br><br>

                        <h4>Site plan</h4>
                         Sigiriya is considered to be one of the most important urban planning sites of the first millennium, 
                         and the site plan is considered very elaborate and imaginative. The plan combined concepts of symmetry 
                         and asymmetry to intentionally interlock the man-made geometrical and natural forms of the surroundings. 
                         On the west side of the rock lies a park for the royals, laid out on a symmetrical plan; the park contains 
                         water-retaining structures, including sophisticated surface/subsurface hydraulic systems, some of which are 
                         working today. The south contains a man-made reservoir; these were extensively used from the previous capital 
                         of the dry zone of Sri Lanka. Five gates were placed at entrances. The more elaborate western gate is thought 
                         to have been reserved for the royals.
